Abstract classess in Typescript are base classes that cannot be instantiated directly. They serve as blueprints for other classes to extend, providing a common structure and behavior.

## Key Characteristics
- **Cannot be instantiated**: Abstract classes cannot be used to crearte objects directly.
- **Blueprint for subclasses**: They define a common interface for derived classes.
- **Abstract methods**: Can contain abstract methods (without implementation) that **must be implemented** by subclasses.
- **Concrete methods**: Can include concrete methods (with implementation) that subclasses can inherit and use.
- **Properties**: Can have properties that subclasses can inherit. Also, Abstract classes can include properties with `abstract` modifier. If an abstract modifier is used, the property must be implemented by subclasses.
