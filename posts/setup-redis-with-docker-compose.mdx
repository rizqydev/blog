**Redis** is a popular in-memory database used world wide. Many developers use Redis in their projects; therefore, it's worthwhile to learn it. 
In this article, we will learn how to install Redis using **Docker Compose**. I chose Docker Compose because the installation is very easy and work across various multiple operating systems. 

## Step 1 Create a file named `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7.2-alpine
    container_name: redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  redis-data:
```

## Step 2: Run the Compose File
In your terminal, we can input the command below:
```bash
docker-compose up -d 
``` 
This will pull Redis image (if not already available), create the container, and start in the background.

## Step 3: Test the Redis container
You can connect to Redis CLI:
```bash
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
```
