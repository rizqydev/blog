        I'm a web developer. Alhamdulillah, I first worked in December 2017 and until now I am still working in this field.
        During my career, I have worked more as a fullstack web developer. I have worked with PHP, Javascript, Typescript, and Go progamming languages.
        Thought this blog. I want to share what I have learned. Thank you for visiting my blog. Hopefully this blog is useful for you.
