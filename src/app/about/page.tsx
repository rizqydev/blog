        Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is <strong>Rizqy Nurhaqy</strong>. I&apos;m Computer Systems graduate who has
        been working in web development for over 5 years. Most of the time, I work as a fullstack
        web programmer, but I also enjoy focusing on either backend or frontend when needed. I
        started with PHP frameworks like Codigniter and Laravel, and later explored other
        technologies like Express.js, Hapi.js, and Gin (Golang). On the frontend side, I&apos;ve
        used Vue, React, Nuxt.js and Next.js in different projects. I&apos;m passionate about
        coding, especially anything related to building pratical solutions and learning new tools.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-8 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100">
        I consider myself someone who, inshaAllah, is always eager to learn, improve, and do my best
        in whatever responsibility I take on.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-8 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100">
        Outsite of work, I love spending time with my family--my parents, my wife, and our children.
        In my free time, I enjoy reading the Qur&apos;an and books about Arabic and Islamic
        teachings. These activities help me stay spritually grounded and continue learning about my
        faith.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md mt-4 text-justify leading-8 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100">
        I also enjoy sport, especially fustal, which I usually play once a week with friends. I like
        jogging as well--just a simple way to sweat and stay healthy. This blog is a small place
        where I share what I&apos;ve learned, my experiences, and my thoughts. I hope you find it
        useful and inspiring. If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to reach out!
